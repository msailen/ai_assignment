# Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI):

- Intelligence is the ability to learn and solve problems.
- Artificial Intelligence is a branch of science that focuses on building machines that can think and act like humans.
- AI is the study of intellectual/mental processes as computational processes.
- AI is unique, sharing borders with Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy, Psychology, Biology, Cognitive Science and many others.
- To conclude, AI can be described as an attempt to build machines that can think and act like humans, able to learn and use knowledge to solve
  problems on their own.

# AI Perspectives: acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally

There are 4 main views of AI

> acting humanly
> thinking humanly
> acting rationally
> thinking rationally

## acting humanly-The Turing Test

- This is a problem that has greatly troubled AI researchers for years. They ask the question “when can we count a machine as being intelligent?”
- The most famous response is attributed to Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computing pioneer. The famous “Turing Test” was named after him, based on ideas he expressed in a paper published in 1950.
- Human interrogates entity via teletype for 5 minutes. If, after 5 minutes, human cannot tell whether entity is human or machine, then the entity must be counted as intelligent.
- To date, no program has yet passed the Turing Test.
- In order to pass the Turing Test, a program that succeeded would need to be capable of:
  speech recognition, natural language understanding and generation, and speech synthesis,
  knowledge representation, learning, and automated reasoning and decision making.

## thinking humanly

Thinking humanly means trying to understand and model how the human mind works.
• There are at least two possible routes that humans use to find the answer to a question: – We reason about it to find the answer. This is called “introspection”. – We conduct experiments to find the answer, drawing upon scientific techniques to conduct controlled experiments and measure change.
• The field of Cognitive Science focuses on modeling how people think.

## acting rationally

- Acting rationally means acting to achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs or understanding about the world.
- An agent is a system that perceives an environment and acts within that environment.
- An intelligent agent is one that acts rationally with respect to its goals. For example, an agent that is designed to play a game should make moves that increase its chances of winning the game.
- When constructing an intelligent agent, emphasis shifts from designing the theoretically best decision-making procedure to designing the best decision-making procedure possible within the circumstances in which the agent is acting.
- Logical approaches may be used to help find the best action, but there are also other approaches.
- Achieving so-called “perfect rationality”, making the best decision theoretically possible, is not usually possible due to limited resources in a real environment (e.g., time, memory, computational power, uncertainty, etc.).

## thinking rationally

• Trying to understand how we actually think is one route to AI.
• But another approach is to model how we should think.
• The “thinking rationally” approach to AI uses symbolic logic to capture the laws of rational thought as symbols that can be manipulated.
• Reasoning involves manipulating the symbols according to well-defined rules, kind of like algebra.
• The result is an idealized model of human reasoning. This approach is attractive to theoretists, i.e., modeling how humans should think and reason in an ideal world.

# History Of AI

- In 1931, Goedel layed the foundation of Theoretical Computer Science1920-30s. He published the first universal formal language and showed that math itself is either flawed or allows for unprovable but true statements.
- In 1936, Turing reformulated Goedel’s result and church’s extension thereof.
- In 1956, John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" as the topic of the Dartmouth Conference, the first conference devoted to the subject.
- In 1957, The General Problem Solver (GPS) demonstrated by Newell, Shaw & Simon
- In 1958, John McCarthy (MIT) invented the Lisp language.
- In 1959, Arthur Samuel (IBM) wrote the first game-playing program, for checkers, to achieve sufficient skill to challenge a world champion.
- In 1963, Ivan Sutherland's MIT dissertation on Sketchpad introduced the idea of interactive graphics into computing.
- In 1966, Ross Quillian (PhD dissertation, Carnegie Inst. of Technology; now CMU) demonstrated semantic nets
- In 1967, Dendral program (Edward Feigenbaum, Joshua Lederberg, Bruce Buchanan, Georgia Sutherland at Stanford) demonstrated to interpret mass spectra on organic chemical compounds.First successful knowledge-based program for scientific reasoning.
- In 1967, Doug Engelbart invented the mouse at SRI
- In 1968, Marvin Minsky & Seymour Papert publish Perceptrons, demonstrating limits of simple neural nets.
- In 1972, Prolog developed by Alain Colmerauer.
- In Mid 80’s, Neural Networks become widely used with the Backpropagation algorithm (first described by Werbos in 1974).
- 1990, Major advances in all areas of AI, with significant demonstrations in machine learning,
  intelligent tutoring, case-based reasoning, multi-agent planning, scheduling, uncertain reasoning,
  data mining, natural language understanding and translation, vision, virtual reality, games, and
  other topics.
- In 1997, Deep Blue beats the World Chess Champion Kasparov
- In 2002,iRobot, founded by researchers at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, introduced Roomba, a vacuum cleaning robot. By 2006, two million had been sold.
- 2001- present: Evolution of Big Data and deep learning

# Foundations of AI

## Philosophy

• Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
• How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
• Where does knowledge come from?
• How does knowledge lead to action?

Rationalism, Dualism, Materialism, Empiricism, Induction, Logical Positivism, Confirmation Theory.

## Economics

How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
How should we do this when others may not go along?
How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?

Utility, Decision Theory, Game Theory, Operations Research.

## Psychology

How do humans and animals think and act?
Behaviourism, Cognitive psychology.

The three key steps of a knowledge-based agent:

1. the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation
2. the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive internal representations
3. These are in turn retranslated back into action.

## Linguistics

How does language relate to thought?
Verbal Behavior — behaviorist approach to language learning

Computational linguistics or natural language processing and knowledge representation.

## Neuroscience

How do brains process information?

Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, especially the brain. We are still a long way from understanding how cognitive processes actually work. The truly amazing conclusion is that a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness or, brains cause minds.The only real alternative theory is mysticism: that minds operate in some mystical realm that is beyond physical science.

## Mathematics

What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
What can be computed?
How do we reason with uncertain information?
The main three fundamental areas are logic, computation and probability.

Algorithm, incompleteness theorem, computable, tractability, NP completeness, Non deterministic polynomial and probability.

## Computer Science

How can we build an efficient computer?
Operational computer and operational programmable computer

AI has pioneered many ideas that have made their way back to mainstream computer science, including time sharing, interactive interpreters, personal computers with windows and mice, rapid development environments, the linked list data type, automatic storage management, and key concepts of symbolic, functional, declarative, and object-oriented programming.

## Control Theory

How can artifacts operate under their own control?
Control Theory, Homeostatic and objective function.
